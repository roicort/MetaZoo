# MetaZoo

A zoo of metaheuristic algorithms (please do not feed them) for optimization.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This library is in preview and is not ready for production use.
>
> We're working hard to make this library stable and feature-complete, but until then, expect to encounter bugs,
> missing features, and fatal errors.

## Learning Resources

### Petting zoo

PettingZoo is a small Streamlit app for visualizing and interacting with MetaZoo library.

It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the various metaheuristic algorithms implemented in the MetaZoo library, allowing users to easily experiment with different algorithms and parameters.

### Playgrounds

Playgrounds is a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with the MetaZoo library.

It provides a hands-on environment for users to explore and visualize the behavior of different metaheuristic algorithms.
